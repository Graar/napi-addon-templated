# napi-addon-templated
A repository containing examples of C++ code being wrapped with node N-Api and node-addon-api and (non-working) templated C++

Constructed from the excellent example at:

https://medium.com/@atulanand94/beginners-guide-to-writing-nodejs-addons-using-c-and-n-api-node-addon-api-9b3b718a9a7f

which shows how to wrapper C++ functions and classes for use with Javascript using N-API 
and the node-addon-api package.

This repo has been developed as a vehicle to figure out how to implement the same thing when using templated C++.
